Later ToDo:

- Plugboard settings graphically

  - Lid Closed
  - Lid Open
  - Cover Open
  - Animate between states using 3D library
  - Pan/tilt/zoom
  - Augmented reality view - make it look like it is sitting on a table
    in view of the camera.

Android questions:

- Can I put TabHost in main.xml directly, instead of creating it on the fly as
  was done in ApiDemos?
- Why isn't the Layout Editor working in eclipse?
