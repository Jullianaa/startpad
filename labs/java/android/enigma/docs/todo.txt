Todo:

- Application icon
- Tab icons
- Settings layout
	- Rotors
	- Rings
	- Start
	- Plugboard
- Simulator layout
	- Text output field
	- Rotor display
	- Android keyboard in alpha-only mode? Fixed?

Android questions:

- Can I put TabHost in main.xml directly, instead of creating it on the fly as
  was done in ApiDemos?
- Why isn't the Layout Editor working in eclipse?
