Is it possible to construct English sentences purely from Python keywords?
How about a poem written in Python keywords?

The 30 keywords in Python are:

	and       del       for       is        raise    
	assert    elif      from      lambda    return   
	break     else      global    not       try      
	class     except    if        or        while    
	continue  exec      import    pass      yield    
	def       finally   in        print
	
	with (2.5)

Here' is how they are organized grammatically:

	verb (11): is raise(n) assert return break(n) try continue import(n) pass(n) yield print(n)
	prep (4): for from except in with
	conjunction (4): and or if while
	adj (2): global else
	adv (2): not finally
	noun (3): class lambda exec
	nonsense (2): elif def del

Some sentence fragments:

	yield not for print or raise,
	except while 
	except for del, def finally raise from class x import and return if elif is not yield while 
    
Some extra special words (special methods and module names) that could be added to the pure Keywords:

types/contsants: None, False, int, long, float, str, unicode, tuple, buffer, xrange, set, frozenset,
	dict, file, list, object, set
functions: abs, all, any, basestring, bin, bool, callable, chr, classmethod, cmp, compile, complex,
    delattr, dir, divmod, enumerate, eval, execfile, file, filter, float, format, getattr, globals,
    hasattr, hash, help, hex, id, input, int, isinstance, issubclass, iter, len, map, max, min, next,
    oct, open, ord, pow, print, property, range, raw_input, reduce, reload, repr, reversed, round,
    setattr, slice, sorted, staticmethod, sum, super, type, unichr, unicode, vars, xrange, zip,
