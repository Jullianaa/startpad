Features:

X Factor javascipt out of .htm file
  - Evolution.js
  - Mesh.js
  - GraphZones.js
  - Stats.js
- Sparkline colors - use Windows task manager graph (green on black)
- Sparkline intermittent error - line 168.
- Make work in IE
- Adjust static display cache - only turn on when % of static organisms is over 20%
- Flush triangles of the mesh that were skipped, periodically (so over time, the background
  gradient is more up to date in the stale areas).
- Build sensing of other organisms in a cone to the front of the creature (keep sense area
  constant - evolve distance vs. spread ratio).

Admin:
- Unit test for mesh.js
- Unit test for GraphZones.js
- Unit test for Status.js
- Unit test for Organism
- Unit test for Evo

Bugs:
X Fix sparkline asserts at end of 800 generations
- Allow sparkline to have data gaps - display as holes
- Dead organisms not getting cleared from static display
- clicking anywhere on the screen pauses the game (button doesnt matter)
- Some orgs still have energy > maxenergy
-Some orgs are being born with negative birth energy
-Phantom orgs being drawn on the static org canvas (maybe clear and redrawn a random chunks every turn?)
- Eat amount is getting ridiculous... could be causing weirdness
- Might also be good to fix it to have some energy on the edges of the field (right now its a border of emptiness) 
  because I think it might kill off many of the organisms that are trying to move around (prefers stopped orgs)
